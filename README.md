## Portfolio Introduction
Hello there! My name is Kehinde A, and I am a Backend Developer at Warner Music Group (WMG). Over the past 14 months, I have had the incredible opportunity to work on the Data Platform team, where Iâ€™ve learned a wide range of skills including writing SQL queries, creating and running tests, conducting performance testing, and monitoring systems using New Relic. This experience has been a significant learning journey for me, especially since my background was initially in frontend development and blockchain technology, with no prior experience in backend development.

From a young age, I was fascinated by computers, thanks to my dad who taught me and my siblings how to fix them. My interest in technology deepened when Bitcoin started gaining popularity, leading me down the crypto rabbit hole and eventually into the world of blockchain development. This passion for engineering is what drives me to continuously learn and grow in my field.

During my apprenticeship, I worked with a small but highly skilled team at WMG. There are five of us in total: three engineers and one Technical Management Professional (TMP). Being part of such a small team has allowed me to take on a lot of responsibility, and I am incredibly thankful for the knowledge and support of my coworkers.

My areas of interest include backend development, with a special focus on performance optimization and data management. I enjoy solving complex problems and seeing the impact of my work on the overall success of my team and the company.
