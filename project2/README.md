# Portfolio Website - Frontend Project

## Overview
The Portfolio Website is a dynamic and responsive single-page application created to showcase my work and skills as a software engineer. The project was built using JavaScript and React, leveraging modern web development practices to ensure a smooth user experience. You can explore the project [here](https://portfolio-seven-puce-68.vercel.app/).

The purpose of this portfolio website was to create an online presence that could effectively display my projects, skills, and experience to potential employers and collaborators.

Before this project, I lacked a centralized place to showcase my work in a professional manner. The goal was to build a site that is both functional and visually appealing, making it easy for visitors to navigate through my projects and learn more about my background.

## Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** React
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Deployment:** Vercel

React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable UI components and efficient rendering. CSS was used for custom styling to maintain control over the design aesthetics, ensuring the portfolio is both visually appealing and responsive.

## Design and Architecture:
The API is structured to handle various endpoints that manage playlists and songs. This includes creating, deleting, and retrieving playlists and songs, as well as managing relationships between them. Below is a simplified overview of the architecture:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores all data related to playlists and songs.
- **API Endpoints:** Flask handles requests and interacts with the database.

## Challenges:
One of the main challenges was ensuring the website remained responsive across different devices. I solved this by implementing media queries in the CSS and testing the site on multiple screen sizes.

## Overview of Completed App:
The final portfolio website features a clean and modern design, with sections dedicated to showcasing my projects, experience, and contact information. Key functionalities include:
- Dynamic rendering of portfolio items
- Responsive design ensuring optimal viewing on all devices
- Smooth scrolling and interactive elements

This project taught me the importance of modular design and the benefits of using a component-based framework like React. It also reinforced my skills in responsive web design and modern CSS techniques.
