# Inventory Project: Full-Stack CRUD Application

## Overview
This Inventory Project is a Full-Stack (frontend and backend) RESTful CRUD application designed to manage and track items within an inventory system. The project allows users to view, add, edit, and delete items, providing a comprehensive tool for inventory management. You can explore the live project [here](https://demozon.onrender.com/).

The purpose of this project was to create a system that simplifies the management of inventory items by allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This application addresses the common need for businesses and individuals to keep track of their inventory efficiently.

Before this project, there was a need for a streamlined and user-friendly tool to manage inventory items. The goal was to build an application that would allow users to easily interact with inventory data, whether viewing all items, inspecting details of a single item, or updating the inventory as needed.

## Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Database:** SQLite

The tech stack was chosen to leverage the benefits of a modern, responsive frontend with React and a robust, efficient backend with Express.js and SQLite. React provides a dynamic user interface, while Express.js and SQLite offer a lightweight and effective solution for backend operations and data storage.

## Design and Architecture:
The project is structured into two main parts:

1. **Frontend (React):**
   - The React frontend provides a responsive and interactive user interface for managing inventory items. Key components include:
     - **Inventory List:** Displays all items in the inventory.
     - **Item Detail:** Shows detailed information for a selected item.
     - **Add/Edit Form:** Allows users to add or edit items through a form.

2. **Backend (Express.js with SQLite):**
   - The Express.js backend handles all the CRUD operations, interacting with the SQLite database to store and manage inventory data. RESTful API endpoints include:
     - `GET /items:` Fetch all inventory items.
     - `GET /items/:id:` Fetch details of a specific item.
     - `POST /items:` Add a new item to the inventory.
     - `PUT /items/:id:` Update an existing item.
     - `DELETE /items/:id:` Remove an item from the inventory.

## Challenges:
One challenge was ensuring data consistency between the frontend and backend, particularly during update and delete operations. This was resolved by implementing robust error handling and validation mechanisms on both sides.

## Overview of Completed App:
The final application successfully allows users to manage inventory items with ease. The main features include:
- Viewing all items in the inventory
- Viewing detailed information on individual items
- Adding new items to the inventory
- Editing existing items
- Deleting items from the inventory

This project reinforced the importance of full-stack development skills, particularly the need to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend. It also highlighted the value of continuous testing and iteration during development.
